Employee Management System - (Personal Project)

Developed an Employee Management System using Spring Boot, enabling 
users to register, log in, view their profiles, access a list of all users, update 
their profiles, and delete their accounts.
Utilized Spring Boot with Spring Security to manage user authentication 
and authorization, and implemented BCryptPasswordEncoder for secure 
password encryption. Designed RESTful API endpoints to handle CRUD 
operations, providing a user-friendly interface for efficient employee 
management.
